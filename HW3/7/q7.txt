We are going to write some code to play the game war.  First of all
we need the following object.  Please 


War Player Object
 
 // members
 Card[] _my_cards; // pointer to an array of card points

 // methods

 name: constructor
 desc: allocates an array of card pointers, and
 fills them with objects from a deck
 params: Deck d
 return: n/a
 1) allocate an array of 26 card pointers
 2) fill the array with card objects from the deck

 name: compare
 desc: compares this war object with another, returns 1 
 if this object wins, 0 if we tie, -1 if this object loses
 params: WarPlayer enemy
 1) for each card in _my_cards, do steps 2-4
 2)  compare the the card with the corresponding enemy's card
 3)  the card with the highest number scores a win
 4)  ties are broken by suit.  SPADES > DIAMONDS > HEARTS > CLUBS
 5) if this object scored more wins than the enemy, return 1
 6) if they tied, return 0
 7) return -1
