I would like you to use your new coord object from the previous question
in this question.  Create Line.java based off of the following design document.


Line Object

 // members
 double _m; // slope of the line 
 double _b; // y intercept of the line

 // methods
 
 name: constructor
 desc: uses two coord objects to find the equation of a line
 params:  Coord p1, Coord p1
 return: n/a
 1) find the slope of the line
 2) find the y intercept 

 name: intersection
 desc: find the intersection of this line with the 
  parameter.  
 params: Line other
 return: Coord - pointer to a coord object with the intercept
 1) calculate the difference between this's intercept 
 other's intercept
 2) calculate the differece between other's slope and this's
 slope
 3) divide the result of 1 by 2.  this is the x coordinate of the 
 intercept.  
 4) multiple the slope by the result of 3, add the intercept.
 this is the y coordinate of the slope
 5) create a new coord ojbect with the x,y of the intercept.
 6) return the new coord object.
