Please write the following Coord.java file based on this design document.
This object should be encapsulated.

// members
 double _x;
 double _y;

// methods

 name: constructor
 desc: sets the members passed on the params
 params: int x, int y
 return: n/a
 1) store x in _x
 2) store y in _y

 name: slope
 desc: calculates the slope of a line between this
 object and the parameter
 params: Coord c
 return: double - the slope
 1) calculate the change in y coords
 2) calculate the change in x coords
 3) return the change in y divided by change in x

 name: y_intercept
 desc: calculate the y intercept of a line through
 this point with with a given slope.
 params: double slope 
 1) return _y - slope * _x;
